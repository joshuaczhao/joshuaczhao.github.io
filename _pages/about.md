I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu), advised by [Prof. Saurabh Bagchi](https://www.saurabhbagchi.us). Previously, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Computer Engineering from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) in 2021.

My research interests lie in security and privacy of machine learning. During my time at Purdue, I have worked on projects focused on privacy attacks in distributed learning (federated learning) and also byzantine robustness. I am also currently engaged on projects relating to adversarial machine learning. In particular, I am exploring improving the fundamental tradeoff on adversarial robustness and generalization accuracy.
